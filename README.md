# LinkedList

This script implements a LinkedList data structure in Python using classes. It provides functionalities to create a linked list, append elements, access elements by index, modify elements, insert elements at a specific index, check for element existence, compare linked lists, delete elements by index, and remove elements by value.

## Usage

To use the LinkedList data structure, follow the examples provided in the script. Here's a breakdown of the different parts:

### Part A

- Example 1 demonstrates the creation of an empty linked list and a linked list initialized with values.
- Example 2 shows the appending of elements to the linked list.
- Example 3 demonstrates accessing elements by index.
- Example 4 shows how to modify elements by index.
- Example 5 demonstrates the insertion of elements at specific indices.

### Part B

- Example 1 demonstrates checking if an element exists in the linked list.
- Example 2 shows how to compare two linked lists for equality.
- Example 3 demonstrates deleting elements by index.
- Example 4 shows how to remove elements by value.

## Class Overview

The script defines the following classes:

### Node

- Represents a single node in the linked list.
- Contains the `value` of the node and a reference to the `next_node`.

### LinkedList

- Represents the linked list data structure.
- Initializes with an optional iterable object to populate the initial values.
- Provides methods for appending elements, accessing elements by index, modifying elements, inserting elements, checking for element existence, comparing linked lists, deleting elements by index, and removing elements by value.

## Running the Script

To run the script, execute it using a Python interpreter:

    python main.py


Make sure the script and any required dependencies are in the same directory.

Feel free to modify the script or incorporate it into your own code as needed.

I hope this README helps you understand and use the provided LinkedList implementation. If you have any further questions, please let me know!
